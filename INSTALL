Requirements
============

GLib >= 2.32
GTK+ >= 3.4.3
GtkSourceView >= 3.4.1
GtkSpell >= 3.0 (not yet released, see note below)
libgee
gettext
gsettings-desktop-schemas (optional)

And for building the sources:
CMake >= 2.6.4
Vala >= 0.17.1 (may be optional)
ITS Tool

If you are installing LaTeXila from a tarball, you don't have to install Vala
because the C code is already generated.

You also probably want to install Latexmk or Rubber. Latexmk is used by default
for compiling documents.

GtkSpell 3.0 can be found on the mercurial (hg) repository [1]. The official web
site is hosted on sourceforge [2]. And there is a Debian package available [3].

Simple install procedure
========================

$ cd build/			# go to the build directory
$ cmake ../			# run the Makefile generator
$ make				# build LaTeXila
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ make install			# install LaTeXila


Simple uninstall procedure
==========================

All the files installed are listed in the "install_manifest.txt" file.
So you can uninstall LaTeXila by doing this:

$ cd build/
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt


Configuration
=============

* Change the install prefix directory

	Default value: /usr/local/

	Run cmake with this option:
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/directory/


* Change the data directory

	Default value: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/latexila/

	Run cmake with this option:
	-DDATA_DIR=/path/to/data/directory/


* Change the man page directory

	Default value: CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/man/man1/

	Run cmake with this option:
	-DMAN_DIR=/path/to/man/directory/


* Generate the C code from the Vala files

	Default value: OFF in tarballs; ON in Git.

	Run cmake with this option:
	-DBUILD_VALA=ON


* Better integration with GNOME, depends on gsettings-desktop-schemas

	Default value: OFF

	Run cmake with this option:
	-DWITH_GNOME=ON

	The only use of this is for knowing the system fixed width font (most
	probably "Monospace 10").


* GSettings schema compilation (with glib-compile-schemas)

	Default value: ON

	To disable this option, run cmake with:
	-DCOMPILE_SCHEMA=OFF

	Useful to set this option OFF for packages.


* Set a custom Vala compiler

	By default, the right "valac-X.Y" is searched in the directories listed
	by the PATH environment variable. If Vala 0.12 is required for example,
	CMake search the binary "valac-0.12".

	But if you want to use another valac binary located in a strange
	directory, you can run cmake with:
	-DVALAC=/path/to/your/valac

	Pay attention that if you use this option, there is no check to see if
	you specify the right version of Vala.
