LaTeXila requires GTK+-2.16.x and GtkSourceView 2.4.x minimum.
For the compilation, CMake 2.6.2 minimum is also required.

Simple install procedure
========================

$ tar xvf latexila-0.0.1.tar.gz		# unpack the sources
$ cd latexila-0.0.1/build/		# go to the build directory
$ cmake ../				# run the Makefile generator
$ make					# build LaTeXila
$ make translations			# build the *.mo files
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ make install				# install LaTeXila

Simple uninstall procedure
==========================

All the files installed are listed in the "install_manifest.txt" file.
So you can uninstall LaTeXila by doing this:

$ cd latexila-0.0.1/
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

Configuration
=============

* Disable Native Language Support (NLS)
	run cmake with this option: -DENABLE_NLS=OFF
	then you don't need to run "make translations"

* Change the install directory
	run cmake with this option:
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/directory/
