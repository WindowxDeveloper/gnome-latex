Installation
============

LaTeXila requires GTK+-2.16.x and GtkSourceView 2.6.x.
Maybe it will work with older versions of GTK and GtkSourceView but it's not
supported.

Simple install procedure:

	$ tar xvf latexila-0.0.1.tar.gz		# unpack the sources
	$ cd latexila-0.0.1/build_directory/	# go to the build directory
	$ cmake ../				# run the Makefile generator
	$ make					# build LaTeXila
	[ Become root if necessary ]
	$ make install				# install LaTeXila

Simple uninstall procedure:

	All the files installed are listed in the "install_manifest.txt" file
	located in the build directory. So you can uninstall LaTeXila by doing
	this:

	$ cd latexila-0.0.1/build_directory/
	[ Become root if necessary ]
	$ xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

See the file "INSTALL" for more detailed information.
