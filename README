LaTeXila
========

This is the version 3.27.0 of LaTeXila.

LaTeXila is an Integrated LaTeX Environment for the GNOME desktop.

LaTeXila is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or
later, see the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The web site:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/LaTeXila

Dependencies
------------

* GLib >= 2.50
* GTK+ >= 3.22
* GtkSourceView >= 3.99.6
* Tepl >= 3.99.0 - https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tepl
* gspell >= 1.0
* gee-0.8 >= 0.10
* gettext
* gsettings-desktop-schemas
* Latexmk >= 4.31 (optional, but strongly recommended)

And for building the sources:
* Vala >= 0.34 (may be optional)
* yelp-tools

If you are installing LaTeXila from a tarball, you don't have to install Vala
because the C code is already generated.

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure from a tarball:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of LaTeXila plus its dependencies from Git, Jhbuild
is recommended. LaTeXila is in the gnome-world moduleset. An example of a
jhbuildrc file for LaTeXila is provided:
