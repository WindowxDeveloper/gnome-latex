Guidelines for LaTeXila
=======================

LaTeXila source code is maintained using the Git version control system and is
available at the following location:

    git://git.gnome.org/latexila

A Web Interface is available at:

    http://git.gnome.org/browse/latexila

You can download the source code from the Git repository by doing:

    $ git clone git://git.gnome.org/latexila

Later, to take the new commits you just have to do:

    $ git pull

An easy way to build LaTeXila and its dependencies is to use jhbuild.

If you want to contribute to LaTeXila, contact the main developer (see the
file AUTHORS).

To create a patch, make first one or several commits (in another branch) and
then use the 'git format-patch' command. You can submit your patch to the
GNOME bugzilla.

Alternatively, if you have a GitHub account, you can make a pull request.
A GitHub repository is available, so you can fork it easily:

    https://github.com/swilmet/latexila

There are some rules to follow when coding:
    - indentation: 4 spaces
    - lines: 90 characters maximum (in some cases it can be a little more)
    - no trailing spaces
    - /* ... */ comments for delimiting code sections
    - // ... comments otherwise (e.g. for explaining just one line)
    - some spaces almost everywhere:
        - function (blah);                // not function(blah);
        - int num = 5;                    // not int num=5;
        - if (! foo)                      // not if (!foo)
        - for (int i = 0 ; i < max ; i++) // not for(int i=0;i<max;i++)
        - etc...
    - do not use 'var' for declaring variables, unless the type is very long
    - git commits: max 72 characters for the first line, followed by a blank
      line and then the description
    - same coding style everywhere

How to debug LaTeXila with gdb?
