How to contribute to GNOME LaTeX
================================

The Git version control system is used. Read the following wiki pages to know
how to create and send patches to bugzilla, and the conventions for the commit
messages:

Code conventions
----------------

For consistency, there are some conventions to follow for the code.

For Vala and C:
    - No trailing spaces.
    - Use blank lines to space out blocks of code (only one blank line is enough).
    - Space out each case in a switch, i.e. have a blank line after each 'break;'.
    - As a general rule of thumb, when modifying a file use the same coding
      style of that file.

For Vala:
    - Indentation: 4 spaces.
    - Lines: 90 characters maximum (in some cases it can be a little more).
    - /* ... */ comments for delimiting code sections.
    - // ... comments otherwise (e.g. for explaining just one line).
    - Curly braces are always on a separate line.
    - For one-line blocks (if, for, while, etc), no curly braces.
    - Some spaces almost everywhere:
        - function (blah);                // not function(blah);
        - int num = 5;                    // not int num=5;
        - if (! foo)                      // not if (!foo)
        - for (int i = 0 ; i < max ; i++) // not for(int i=0;i<max;i++)
        - etc...
    - Do not use 'var' for declaring variables, unless the type is very long.
      The type of a variable is useful to understand the code, it is a form of
      self-documentation.

For C:
    - Follow the same coding style as GtkSourceView:
      https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtksourceview/tree/HACKING
    - No maximum line length (but short lines are better).
    - Spacing differences with Vala:
    	- if (!foo)
	- for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
