Translations
============

LaTeXila uses ITS Tool for translating XML files. This is used for the
documentation (in Mallard), the build tools and the templates.

Here is a summary page about the translation status of LaTeXila:

    http://l10n.gnome.org/module/latexila/

If you want to help, see the "How Tos" section of this page:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject

For translating the letter template (which require to translate it in one big
block), there is a helper script in data/templates/tex2po.sh, so you can write
the letter in a .tex file, with syntaxic color, etc.
