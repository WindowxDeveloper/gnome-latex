General Information
===================

This is the version @PACKAGE_VERSION@ of LaTeXila.
LaTeXila is an Integrated LaTeX Environment for the GNOME desktop.

LaTeXila is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or
later, see the file "COPYING" for more information.

The web site:

    http://projects.gnome.org/latexila


Requirements
============

GLib >= @GLIB_REQUIRED_VERSION@
GTK+ >= @GTK_REQUIRED_VERSION@
GtkSourceView >= @GTKSOURCEVIEW_REQUIRED_VERSION@
GtkSpell >= @GTKSPELL_REQUIRED_VERSION@ (not yet released, see note below)
libgee
gettext
gsettings-desktop-schemas

And for building the sources:
Vala >= @VALA_REQUIRED_VERSION@ (may be optional)
ITS Tool

If you are installing LaTeXila from a tarball, you don't have to install Vala
because the C code is already generated.

You also probably want to install Latexmk or Rubber. Latexmk is used by default
for compiling documents.

GtkSpell 3.0 can be found on the mercurial (hg) repository [1]. The official web
site is hosted on sourceforge [2]. And there is a Debian package available [3].

Translations
============

LaTeXila uses ITS Tool for translating XML files. This is used for the
documentation (in Mallard), the build tools and the templates.

Here is a summary page about the translation status of LaTeXila:

    http://l10n.gnome.org/module/latexila/

If you want to help, see the "How Tos" section of this page:

    https://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject

For translating the letter template (which require to translate it in one big
block), there is a helper script in data/templates/tex2po.sh, so you can write
the letter in a .tex file, with syntaxic color, etc.
