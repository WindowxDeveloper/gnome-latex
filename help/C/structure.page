<title>Document's Structure</title>

<synopsis>
  <p>The list of chapters, sections, sub-sections and other things like tables,
  figures, â€¦ of a document, to easily navigate in it.</p>
</synopsis>

<section>
  <title>Display the structure</title>

  <p>
    The structure can be displayed in the side panel. If the side panel is hidden,
    go to
    <guiseq>
      <gui style="menu">View</gui>
      <gui style="menu">Side panel</gui>
    </guiseq>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The structure's content is not automatically updated. That's why there is a refresh
    button. If text is inserted in the document, the position of an item (e.g. a section)
    remains correct, as far as the item is still there, and is not modified.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Actions</title>

  <p>
    Some actions such as "cut", "copy" or "comment" can be performed on a
    structure's item. Either by a right click, or via the
    <gui style="menu">Structure</gui> menu.
  </p>
</section>

<section its:locNote="Do not translate the words TODO and FIXME. They are special comments
that can be inserted in LaTeX documents.">
  <title>TODOs and FIXMEs</title>

  <p>
    It can be useful to add TODOs and FIXMEs comments in the document. They will be
    displayed in the structure. Example:
  </p>

  <code mime="text/x-tex">
%TODO a remaining task
%FIXME something is broken</code>
</section>
</page>
