README for the GitHub mirror of LaTeXila
========================================

The LaTeXila repository at GitHub is a **read-only mirror**! Do *not* create
pull requests there. The purpose is just to ease the creation of clones, so you
can host your branches.

See the [homepage of LaTeXila](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/LaTeXila) to know
how to contribute.
